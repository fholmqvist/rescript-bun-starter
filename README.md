# rescript-bun-starter

A starter for getting up and running quickly with ReScript and Bun.

## Getting started

Run installation:

```bash
npm i
```

This uses `npm` to install packages, but you can use `bun install` as well if you'd like.

All dev-time scripts can be run at the same time via:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Check out `package.json` and change scripts as you see fit.
